What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

 - POST: Updates data on the server. 
What is an HTTP request?
 - A request for infomration from a server using the HTTP Protocol (Most common).
What is an HTTP response?
 - The data sent back from the server.
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
 - Characteristics of the request/response. Date/Time, Server, Outcome, language, age, last modified.
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
 - The URL is parsed by the browser, the browser first searches for the information in the cache, then on the router, then the ISP, and finally the DNS Server. If no address is found then the DNS server will respond that nothing was located. Otherwise the information is located on the server, and the response is sent back to the browser which renders it for the user.
